      To start using React, you’ll need intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. Familiarize yourself with ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features, as
      React leverages them. To set up a React environment, use the
      create-react-app tool, which provides a scaffolded project structure. Once
      you’ve created your React app, you can explore components, state
      management, and lifecycle methods to build powerful and interactive web
      applications.
